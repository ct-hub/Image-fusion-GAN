Here are the weights of a sample pre-trained model.

The Generator 1 has a U-Net architecture, and spectral normalization was
only performed on the discriminators.

Training parameters:
- Epochs: 40.
- Learning rate generators: 5e-5.
- Learning rate discriminators: 1e-4.
- Batch size: 4.

This model was pre-trained on the RGB-NIR dataset.
